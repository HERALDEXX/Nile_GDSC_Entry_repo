# 🟡 Intermediate Task – Build a Responsive Calculator (Without `eval()`)

Welcome to the **Intermediate Frontend Challenge** for the Nile GDSC Web Development Team!  
Your goal is to build a **functional, responsive calculator** using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — without using the `eval()` function.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **fully functional calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations and works smoothly on all screen sizes.

---

## 🧩 Requirements

### 🧱 Core Features

1. Perform **basic arithmetic operations**:  
   ➕ Addition  
   ➖ Subtraction  
   ✖️ Multiplication  
   ➗ Division  

2. **Do NOT use `eval()`** — you must implement your **own safe logic** to parse and process operations.  

3. Include buttons for:
   - Numbers (0–9)  
   - Decimal (`.`)  
   - Operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)  
   - **Clear (C)** and **Delete (⌫)**  

4. The **UI must be responsive and user-friendly**, adapting gracefully to mobile and desktop screens.

---

## 🖥️ Technical Requirements

- Use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript only** (no frameworks).  
- Maintain **clean, modular code** — split logic into functions.  
- Include proper **error handling** (e.g., division by zero).  
- Use **Git** and **GitHub** for version control.  

---

## 🌟 Bonus (Optional Enhancements)

- 🌓 **Dark Mode Toggle** — switch between light and dark themes.  
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Input Support** — allow users to type numbers and operations.  
- 🎨 **Creative UI Design** — experiment with neumorphism or glassmorphism styles.
